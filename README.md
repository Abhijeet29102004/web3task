in the main method, I have created two Car objects with dummy data and tested
some of the methods using those objects. I have made collision detection method to
measure the distance and return true if distance between two cars is less than
0.01 units otherwise false. I have made time in collision method to calculate the 
time before collision between the cars. Methods such as accelerate and decclerate 
would increase and decrease the speed of car respectively. Method move will update
the coordinates of car depending upon the angle in which it is moving and the speed
it attains. I have made this code in 2D considering out cartesian coordinates .
